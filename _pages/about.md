Zhiguo Zhang is now a Professor with the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China. His research covers a variety of topics in computational neuroscience, biomedical signal processing, neural engineering, and digital signal processing. Specifically, his research focus is to develop and apply advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze brain signals and images, and subsequently investigate how the brain dynamically coordinates and integrates neural circuits to support behavior and cognition and how such brain dynamics could be altered in neurological and psychiatric diseases. He is also interested in utilizing brain imaging data in practical and clinical applications, such as early diagnosis of neurologic disorders, brain-computer interfaces, and enhancement of cognitive performance.
